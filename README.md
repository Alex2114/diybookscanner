diybookscanner
==============

This _was_ the official git repository for diybookscanner.org. It still contains interesting information.

Contents
--------
* openscad/ : conversion of the 0.9.20 diybookscanner.org design to openscad (work in progress)
* misc/     : a simple electronic triggering script for use with a foot pedal, and more . Will soon be superseded by https://github.com/diybookscanner/spreads .
* wiki (branch) : the official diybookscanner.org wiki

TODO
----
* port every wooden part from DIY_Book_Scanner.9.2.0.dxf to an independent, 3D layered openscad file
* recreate a sheet with all wooden parts from .9.2.0
* model essential other parts (glass, L brackets, felt pads, ...)
* create an assembled model of .9.2.0
